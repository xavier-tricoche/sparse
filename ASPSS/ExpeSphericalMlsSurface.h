/** Template class to easily build a MLS surface definition based on algebraic spherical fit without normal.
    \param AlgebraicSphereFitterT the spherical fitter class
    The differences with the base template class SphericalMlsSurfaceT are the following:
    -If the input point clouds have normal information, then the fit operation automatically adjusts the sign of the sphere in order to provide a signed scalar field. Otherwise, the scalar field is not signed.
    -The default minimal number of samples to perform the fit is set to 5 here instead of 3.
